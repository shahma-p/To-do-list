# To-Do List App ðŸ“‹

This project is a simple and user-friendly To-Do List App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to add, mark, and delete tasks, and it uses Local Storage to save your tasks so they persist across browser sessions.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Type a task in the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to your list.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete/Incomplete**: Click on a task to toggle its completion status.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks with the close icon.
- **Persistent Storage**: Your tasks are saved in your browser's Local Storage, so your to-do list remains available even after closing the browser.

## Project Structure
The project includes the following files:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the app.
- **style.css**: The CSS file for styling the app.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the functionality for adding, marking, and deleting tasks, as well as saving to and retrieving from Local Storage.
